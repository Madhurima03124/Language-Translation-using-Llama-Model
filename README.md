üåç Language Translation using Llama ü¶ô
This repository showcases a Language Translation model built using the Llama architecture. The model is trained to translate between multiple languages, leveraging datasets from Hugging Face and fine-tuned using LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation) for enhanced performance.

Features:
Multilingual Translation: Translates between various languages efficiently.
Llama Model: Powered by the state-of-the-art Llama architecture for language modeling.
LoRa Adaptation: Low-Rank Adaptation for faster and efficient fine-tuning.
Project Structure:
notebooks/: Contains the core Jupyter notebooks with the translation model and experiments.
Highlights:
Efficient model fine-tuning using LoRa.
Clean implementation using Hugging Face datasets.
